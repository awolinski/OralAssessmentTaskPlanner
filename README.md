# Oral Assessment Task Planner

Designed for undergraduate English-speaking instructors, this application helps teachers plan oral assessments and activities best suited for their course, given the language abilities of their students, and the classroom environment. The application takes approximately fifteen minutes to complete, and there is an option to save each page throughout the process. A final recommendation summary is provided on page nine. Further information about the tool can be found at: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11423-015-9375-8.

## Develop is in progress. 

## TODO: 
    - Embed video/links to help define language levels that show upon button click page 2
    - Create functions to calculate results and display them in the tables
    - Bug fixes such as validation error on page 6/7
    - Re-enable validation once testing is complete 
    - Write unit tests
